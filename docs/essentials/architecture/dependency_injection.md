## Introduction
Dependency injection is a design pattern that allows the separation of object creation and object usage. It helps to reduce tight coupling between classes and promotes code reusability and testability.

## Benefits of Dependency Injection
- Increased modularity and maintainability
- Improved code reusability
- Easier unit testing and mocking
- Better separation of concerns

## Types of Dependency Injection
There are three common types of dependency injection:
1. Constructor Injection
2. Setter Injection
3. Interface Injection

## Implementing Dependency Injection
To implement dependency injection in your project, you can use a dependency injection framework or manually wire dependencies using a container or service locator.
